A model to help robots navigate by classifying the surface the robot is moving on.

Being able to classify the surface a robot is navigating is essential to helping robots integrate with humans in the society be it in households or in factories. The aim here is to classify the surface a robot is moving on into one of nine surfaces(Tiled, concrete, carpet etc.) using data from an IMU sensor which includes data about the robotâ€™s velocity and acceleration.
